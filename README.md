### :wave: Hello!
My name is Ashley (she/they) and I'm a third-year electrical engineering student at the University of Toronto. My main interests include electronics and signal processing. Outside of school, I write music in my spare time and I host community events for Toronto Defiant, an esports organization.
I have experience coding in C++ and C. Additionally, I also have some experience working with embedded systems (Arduino) and analog electronics/ICs.
